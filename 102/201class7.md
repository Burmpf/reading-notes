## Domain modeling

1. Can be used to store info I think? This is very hard to read.

## HTML Tables
[HTML Table Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics)

1. Tables should not be used for layout ebcause it reduces accessibility, creates "tag soup" and are not responisve like the components thety replace are.
2. semantic table elements
  - Table headers: table headers describe the data that is going to be stored in the cells
  - colspan/ rowspan: these allow your cells to expand in the direction you want.
  - col/ colgroup: these elements allow styling columns to be much easier as opposed to styling every cell individually

## JS Constructors and Object Prototypes
[Introducing Constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors)     
[Object Prototypes Using a Constructor](https://ui.dev/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype)

1. A constructor is an object literal but instead of copy/pasting for every new item, it defines the layout for all objects
2. In a constructor "this" binds to the new object
3. Its asking me to explain prototypes and inheritance but I literally have no idea.
