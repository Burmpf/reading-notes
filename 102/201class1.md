[Website Design and Process](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like)
1. Roses are red, violets are blue, HTTP works like "ordering" the website
2. The HTML file is parsed first which allows it to see any linked files from the HTML text, it requests the files from the server, and then parses them
3. You can add images to a website by using an IMG tag in HTML and linking to the img address and giving proper citation or by downloading the img and conecting to it locally
4. To create a string in JS you just put "" around the text. I number is simply a number with no ""
5. A variable in JS is used to reference back to a piece of code so it can be reused, similiar to a function

## Intro to HTML
[Getting Started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)       
[HTML Document Structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure)      
[Metadata in HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML)      
1. An HTML attribute is info about the element 
2. An HTML element consists of a opening tag, the content, and a closing tag
3. An article tag classifies the content of the element as part of an article like a newspaper website while a section element is much more broad.  They help search engines determine whats in the element
4. the typical elements a website has are header, body, and footer. Many sites also include sidebars, nav bars, and main elements
5. Metadata can be used to boost results in search engines by putting things like a description with key words to make it more easily findable.
6. the <meta> tag can be used to determine the language of the site, the author, and other things like the name and content of the page.

[What is JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)            


### Starting a Site
1. The first step to creating a website is to plan it out, set goals and use wireframes to have an idea of layout
2. The most important question to answer when making a website is "what is the goal?"

### Semantics
1. A h1 element should be used over a span element because the h1 element is purpose built for the task (i.e. semantics)
2. Semantics makes reading the code easier and gives the content meaning. You could use a bunch of <div> tags but it would get very cluttered and confusing very quickly

### What is JavaScript?
1. JavaScript is required for animation and changes to the site via interactions 
2. JavaScript can be added to a HTML doc by using a <script> element or by linking a .js doc with the same element
