# Readings: Images, Color, Text

## HTML Media
[Using Images in HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML)       
[Common Image Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types)         
[Choosing Image Formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#choosing_an_image_format)      

1. The alt attribute is great for screen readers or for people to know what was intended to be there if the image fails to load.
2. You can improve accessability of images by adding a lt tag to it or but adding a figcaption to give it context.
3. A figure element would be using when putting a caption on a figure.
4. A gif image is a short animated video and a svg img is one that scales and is very useful for websites.
5. To dsiplay a screenshot of my website I would use a PNG or webP so that text doesnt become fuzzy and unreadable.

## CSS
[Using Color in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Applying_color)       
[Styling HTML Text Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals)

1. The foreground colors are the color selector. It styles the contents of the element which is normally text. Background color is what is sounds like, the color of the element background.
2. I would use complimenting colors to change the color of the text and the background. maybe add a gradient to spice it up. 
3. When choosing font you should consider if it is one of the web safe font families. Some fonts arent availible everywhere.
4. font size changes the size of the font, font weight determines the boldness, and font style determines if it has italics, underline, stuff like that. 
5. to add spacing around the characters in an h1 element you could up the padding or margins, or you could add spaces to the h1.
