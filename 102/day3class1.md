# CSS

## What is CSS?

- Stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- Where HTML is the structure and contents, CSS is the style and layout
- A selector is "selecting" the html element to style
- Next to the selector you must put the styling inside of curly brackets { }
- must name the document .css
- css can be used internal or even inline of a html doc but its best practice to create a stylesheet
- you can add color in many ways
  - you can just use the name of some colors (i.e. "blue"
  - you can use a HEX color code (i.e. "#00000")
  - you can also use RGB (i.e. "rgb(0,0,0,)"0)
- Always use colors that work together well for the text and background
