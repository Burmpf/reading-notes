1. "Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders."

3. "When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result."

If we are gonna use articles about these kinds of topics, can we at least use reputable sources and not USA TODAY? This site is so clearly pushing an agenda.
