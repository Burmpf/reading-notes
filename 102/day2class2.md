## Wireframe and Design

- Wireframe is what UX designers use to plan out the layout for a website. It is very basic and black/white

- tools for wire framing:
  - Pen and paper (lol)
  - UXpin
  - InVision
  - Wireframe.cc
- Steps to make a wireframe:
  1. do your research
      - trends
      - best practices
  2. prepare the reaserch so it can be referenced quickly
  3. Have the flow mapped out
  4. Draft, dopnt draw. Sketch, dont illustrate
      - dont worry about making the wireframe pretty. that comes later
     - think about the layout only
  5. add some detail and get testing
      - add detail in the way youd read the screen, left to right
      - make sure its simple and easy to read/navigate
      - build trust
  6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

## Mozilla HTML basics

- opening and closing tags><
- elements go in tags p
- attributes go inside of the tags on an element i.e. "class="
- nested elements < strong>
- empty elements have no closer i.e. < img>
- Atom makes setting up HTML docs super easy. All you have to do is label it .html and put html into the doc and it builds the structure for you

## Semantics
- refers to the meaning of a code or the "role" of it
- < h1> for example gives the text it holds meaning (header)
- helps search engines understand content
- helps screen readers for accesibility
- helps a developer understand the code better than endles levels of divs
