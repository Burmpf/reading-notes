# JAVASCRIPT

- This is the language Ive been looking forward to learning the most!
- Mopstly used for web browsers
- We can distinguish 3 major parts of what we usually refer to as "JavaScript".

   1. The language itself. This is fairly standard among the various environments, both in the various browsers and in the various server-side environments.
  2. The DOM API - how the language can interact with the various parts of a web page while in the browser. While in this respect the various browsers are getting closer to each other they still differ. Several libraries, most prominently JQuery, is trying to provide a unified API.
  3. The server API (or just API) provided by Node.js or one of the other server-side systems.

- can be used on any text editor (including notepad but seriously dont do that)
- can embed it in the html file or link it to an external 
- when in html use the <script> tags
- you can use alert() to have a pop-up show up in the browser
- you can use prompt to have a window pop up to ask for input and also use document.write to speak back ex:
 <script>
 
var name = prompt("Your name:", ""); 
  
document.write("Hello ", name);
 
</script>
  
-you can do if/else to give options to prompts
