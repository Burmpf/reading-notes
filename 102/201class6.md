# JS: Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM
## JS
[JavaScript Object Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics)          

1. An object in JS is collection of info, like a profile on fb but much more in depth.
2. its good for sending multiple items like a server sending an order to a database and is easier to work with than an array.
3. objects are like arrays but instead of attaching data to values like 0 and 1, it uses its name.
4. if the object property is held in a variable you have to use bracket notation over dot notation
5. This reffers to the object that is currently being used
