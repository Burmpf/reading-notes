# The Coder's Computer Notes

## Text Editors

- Before I even start this I want to clarify I already use atom as my personal text editor and I have a feeling its one of the better ones. Im going into this expecting the quality of life on atom to be standard.

- the article has already mentioned extension aka plugins or on atom, theyre called packages. I've also been lucky enough to experiment with packages and they have been very useful up to this point. I have one in particular that shows me my html/css live so I dont have to switch to my web browser and refresh as I work. 

- I didnt even know Notepad could be used to code. Notepad is so bad that I dont even use it for anything. Actually no one I know uses it for anything.

- Visual Studio Code has something the article refered to as Emmet. I'll have to check this one out

- An IDE is multiple software put together. I dont think I'm at the point of needing this yet. 

## Using the Terminal

- terminals have "shells" and the most commonly used one is called bash
- pwd means Print Working Directory. This tells you what your current directory is.
- ls stands for list
- There are absolute and reletive paths
  - absolute is specified in relation to the root directory
  - reletive is specified in relation to where we are in the system
- ~ is a shortcut the the home dir
- . is current directory 
- .. is parent directory
- cd means Change Directory
  - If you dont use anything else with it, iot will take you to the home dir
- Linux is case sensetive
- "file" gets info on a specific file since files call be called whatever on linux unlike windows where it matters
- ls -a lists the contents of a dir, including hidden files
