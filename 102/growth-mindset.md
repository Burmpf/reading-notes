# Growth Mindset

## What is Growth Mindset?
Growth mindset is Being able to learn and grow without being held down by the belief that you cant based on how smart or sucessful you are.

## 3 reminders for Growth Mindset:
  - Always keep grinding
  - Never stop, Never stopping
  - "If you had one shot, or one opportunity, to seize everything you ever wanted, one moment, would you capture it or just let it slip?"-Eminem
  
  ## Things I'm good at and some things im not
  
areas of strength-

    constant improvement- I enjoy bettering myself. Most opportunities to improve I take (like how I'm taking this course right now)

    Openness-I love constructive feedback and critism. No one is perfect and I strive every day to be better than I was yesterday.

    Integrity- My time in the military deeply instilled this into me. In a job where peoples lives can be on the line, integrity was vital to our success

 

areas for growth-

    Speaking- I am not a very good public speaker. I can do it, but I loath it.
    
    Collaboration- same with speaking. I can do it, but I vastly prefer to work alone and will work to improve in this aspect

    Estimating- I am awful at guessing how long things will take. I always aggresively extend timelines under fear of setting a quicker expectation and failing to meet it.


### Update for 401 python

- not much has changed here. There hasnt been a lot of time or oppertunity to work on shortcomings in a meaningful way yet. I suspect I'll really be able to dig in and work on improving myself once Im out in the workplace daily. 
- I will say I have made some progress with speaking and collabing. The groups for both of the finals so far have went surprisingly well. Our teams worked great together and we were really able to make projects that stood out against our classmates. Also when I did my piece for the presentation, I was able to really be confident in my role since I had my hand in the creation of the things we were talking about.
