# Growth Mindset

## What is Growth Mindset?
Growth mindset is Being able to learn and grow without being held down by the belief that you cant based on how smart or sucessful you are.

## 3 reminders for Growth Mindset:
  - Always keep grinding
  - Never stop, Never stopping
  - "If you had one shot, or one opportunity, to seize everything you ever wanted, one moment, would you capture it or just let it slip?"-Eminem
  
  ## Things I'm good at and some things im not
  
areas of strength-

    constant improvement- I enjoy bettering myself. Most opportunities to improve I take (like how I'm taking this course right now)

    Openness-I love constructive feedback and critism. No one is perfect and I strive every day to be better than I was yesterday.

    Integrity- My time in the military deeply instilled this into me. In a job where peoples lives can be on the line, integrity was vital to our success

 

areas for growth-

    Speaking- I am not a very good public speaker. I can do it, but I loath it.
    
    Collaboration- same with speaking. I can do it, but I vastly prefer to work alone and will work to improve in this aspect

    Estimating- I am awful at guessing how long things will take. I always aggresively extend timelines under fear of setting a quicker expectation and failing to meet it.
