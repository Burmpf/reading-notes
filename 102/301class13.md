1. I dont know how to answer this question but I think I just spent 20 minutes watching a wizard perform magic
2. if it was 5 steps I would say theyd be:
  - set up a foundation (i.e. required files and middleware)
  - apply the middleware (require and app.use)
  - fill in the required functions of the app (i.e.read, update, create, delete)
  - test to make sure they work
  - deploy
