My reading notes journal for Code Fellows

**Growth Mindset**- Growth mindset is believing that it is possible to learn and not be restricted by your thoughts of how snart or talented you are. 

Reminder to myself:
 1. Grind daily. Its hard but it'll be worth
 2. Never stop, never stopping 
 3. "*If you had one shot, one oppertunity, to seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment, would you capture it or just it slip?*"-Eminem
