## NOTES
- Panda is a powerful data anylysis library
- you can use built in methods like .head() to see the top of a dataframe and .tail() to see the end.
- There are way too many methods to list them all. Instead reference the the article linked above.
- you can also target different rows and columns, individual values in cells, etc to make pinpointing what youre looking for easy
- you can use basic math like +- and mean, median, mode, that kind of thing
- much less syntax heavy until you get into the complicated search/sort
- Theres a lot here about stuff I dont know about and dont have time to learn about until its relevant to class!
