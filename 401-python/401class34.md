## NOTES

- Different Envirnoments: local, dev, prod all require different settings so its best to have an approach for each one
- Sensitive data: passwords, keys, etc should be stored in a .env file and not in the settings.py file
- have universal settings when working with a team
- 12 factors for how to build distributed apps:
  - Codebase
  - Dependencies
  - Config
  - Backing services
  - Build, release, run
  - Processes
  - Port binding
  - Concurrency
  - Disposability
  - Dev/prod parity
  - Logs
  - Admin processes

- I need to know why devs have such strange naming conventions for their libraries
- Naming Convention: 
  - give meaningful names to your variables and settings
  - use prefixes for your project specific settings
  - write descriptive comments for your settings
