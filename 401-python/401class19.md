## NOTES
- ideas
  - automatically move files
  - Open youtube whenever a tuber uploads a new video
  - calculate compounding interest
- REGEX IS BACK NOOOOOO
- "Regular Expressions, often shortened as regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not"- from article
- in python, to use regex you need the re module `import re`
- the match() function checks a pattern and input. If they match it returns a match obj. if it does not it returns None.
- Shutil handles high level file management like copying 
- it has:
  -  a copy() function that can copy files 
  -  a copytree() function that can, you guessed it, copy trees
  -  a which() function scans for certain file names
