## NOTES
- Next.js is a framework for React that allows you to do server side rendering and static site generation
- uses webpack and babel
- things to consider when making a project using react:
  - code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel
  - need to do production optimizations such as code splitting
  - want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO
  - write some server side code to connect your React app to your data store
  - react context is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level
  - context is great for features like themes, authentication, and location
  - how to use react context:
    - create a context object using React.createContext()
    - wrap the app in a context provider
    - use the context object in the components you want to access the context
