## NOTES
- cryptography has been around since the romans when Ceasar used a "ceasar cipher" to shift letters around so only he knew what it said
- cryptography is essentially making text gibberish unless you have a cipher to read it. 
- to create such a thing is to encrpyt
- to undo it is to decrypt
- The germnan enigma was a multi-layered substitution cipher
- Frequency analysis is seeing how often some things are used. So for example in the english language we use the letter E a lot!
- brute forcing is a way to get through light encryption but impossible for modern well desgined encryption.
