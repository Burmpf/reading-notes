## NOTES

#### *Classes and Objects*
- In python, objects are variables and functions in a single "entity"
- A class is essentially a template for creating our own object
- __init__ is a function that is called when a class is being initiated to assign values in a class.

#### *Thinking Recursively*
- recursion is the concept of taking big problems and breaking them down into smaller, more manageable problems
- a recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself. This essentially means it will call on itself and continue until some condition is met
- keep the state global
