## Notes:
- in the "act like your time is expensive" article, while I get what theyre trying to say, it comes off real bad. The "being busy is being lazy" thing is stupid. Im super busy and I dont even have time for myself. But I have a family I have to take care of. A daughter who I need to set up for success. So like most people I dont have the luxury of just "not being busy".
- I feel like while the idea they are going for is with good intentions, this mindset seems like a really good way to ruin all the relationships we have.
- "Warren Buffet, investor extraordinaire and a net worth of over $70 billion dollars, has said that for every hundred opportunities he is given, he might say yes to 1–2 of them." this is exactly what im talking about. We arent Warren Buffet and what works for him as a billionaire who has oppertunity thrown at him. We cant afford the luxury of being able to say no to oppertunities just because we dont want to do them.
- Im noticing a trend here. The second article has step 1 as "understand the problem". If I understood the problem I would have already known how to fix it no? If the problem is my not understanding then just saying "well understand it then" makes literally no sense.
- " Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes. I’m serious. You’ll be dumbfounded at how effective this is." like come on this is ridiculous. WE DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF BEING ABLE TO JUST RESTART THINGS. This will make me fall behind before the week is done. I dont have time to be able to just restart!


## Questions:
1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
    - I bring to my career my personal experiences. Ive been through a lot. A lot of people my age havent been to the places I have or gone through the kind of life altering/character building things I have. From losing a half dozen of my homies in afghanistan, and spending 4 years all over the world, Ive been in so many different conditions and climates and cultures. I think being exposed to many cultures and hardships really character builds and gives a lot of perspective many people dont have. Many Americans have never even left their home states, let alone the country. Now that defintely doesnt make me better than anyone, just more "experienced"

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
   1. I'll try my best to really follow the 15 minute rule, and hopefully this time away from my screen can give me a different perspective when I come back.
   2. I'll phone-a-friend. My classmates and the TA's are a huge source of knowledge. They can help me understand most things better than a google search.
   3. Speaking of google, I've underutilized it in an attempt to try to force understanding of a topic. I wont have that luxury with this course. I'll have to learn to use the right search phrases to find solutions to my problems.
