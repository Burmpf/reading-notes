## NOTES
- dunder methods are special methods that are used to implement certain operations on objects
  
- Dunder Methods
  - `__init__` - constructor
  - `__repr__` - string representation of the object
  - `__str__` - string representation of the object
  - `__add__` - addition
  - `__sub__` - subtraction
  - `__mul__` - multiplication
  - `__truediv__` - true division
  - `__floordiv__` - floor division
  - `__mod__` - modulus
  - `__pow__` - power
  - `__len__` - length
  - `__getitem__` - indexing
  - `__setitem__` - assignment
  - `__delitem__` - deletion
  - `__iter__` - iteration
  - `__next__` - iteration
  - `__contains__` - membership
  - `__call__` - calling

- Iterators are objects that can be iterated upon. An object which will return data, one element at a time.
  - Iterable - an object that can return an iterator
  - Iterator - an object that keeps state and produces the next value when you call next() on it
  - Iteration - taking elements from an object until the elements are finished
  - Iterable - an object that can be iterated over

- Generators are a simple way of creating iterators. All the work we mentioned above are automatically handled by generators in Python. Simply speaking, a generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).
