## NOTES
- dynamic routes are routes that are not hard coded into the app
- dynamic routes allows for dynamic urls
- dynamic routes are created by adding square brackets around the route name
- you have to create a file with the name of the route in the pages folder
- you can use the useRouter hook to get the route parameters
- you can use the getStaticProps hook to get the data for the page
- to deploy a next.js app you can use vercel
- to use vercel you have to create an account and link it to your github account
- vercel will automatically deploy your app when you push to github
- vercel is a serverless platform
- when setting using vercel, you can use default settings because it will automatically detect your next.js app
- should finish in under a minute
- Next.js and Vercel
Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and has first-class support for Next.js. When you deploy your Next.js app to Vercel, the following happens by default:

Pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the Vercel Edge Network, which is blazingly fast.
Pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.
