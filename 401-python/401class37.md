## NOTES
- ES6
  - var- function scoped, can be reasigned
  - let- block scoped, can be reasigned
  - const- block scoped, cannot be reasigned
  - arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions
  - template literals are a way to write strings that can span multiple lines and have embedded expressions
  - object destructuring is a way to extract properties from objects and bind them to variables
  
- React

  - JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript
  - jsx is not a string, it is a type of expression
  - jsx describes what the UI should look like
  - jsx prevents injection attacks
  - jsx represents objects
  - Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.
  - React elements are immutable

- Tailwind
  - Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
  - tailwind is inside the classname attribute
  - tailwind can be used with react
  - tailwind is css but with a different syntax
- Next.js
  - a good analogy for next js is react is like linux and next js is like ubuntu (a distro of linux)
  - next js is used by 5 of the fortune 12 companies
  - focuses on server side rendering (which is awesome)
