## NOTES
- conditional rendering
  - if/else
  - element variables
  - ternary operator
  - short circuit operator
- conditional rendering with && operator
  - if the condition is true, the element right after && will appear in the output
  - if the condition is false, React will ignore and skip over it
- conditional rendering with ternary operator
  - if the condition is true, the first element will appear in the output
  - if the condition is false, the second element will appear in the output
- conditional rendering with inline if with logical && operator
  - if the condition is true, the element right after && will appear in the output
  - if the condition is false, React will ignore and skip over it
- conditional rendering with inline if-else with conditional operator
  - if the condition is true, the first element will appear in the output
  - if the condition is false, the second element will appear in the output
- conditional rendering with prevent component from rendering
  - return null
- lists and keys
  - lists are a good way to render multiple components
  - lists can be rendered in React in two different ways
    - using an array of JavaScript objects
    - using an array of JSX elements
  - keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed
  - keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity
- lifting state up
  - often, several components need to reflect the same changing data
  - we recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor
  - we can then pass the state back down to the components that need it as props
  - we can use the same stateful component for multiple different inputs
- composition vs inheritance
  - components can refer to other components in their output
  - this lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail
  - a component may refer to other components as either children or as a prop
