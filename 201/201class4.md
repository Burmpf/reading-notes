## HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## HTML
[Creating Hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

1. to create a link you must use an anchor element and link it to the place you want it to go.
2. teh href attribute contians the location of where the link will go.
3. to ensure accessibility on links we should add key words for search engines or use descriptive link text to be clear for the readers

## CSS Layout
[CSS Layout: Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)
[Css Layout: Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)

1. Normal flow is the layout of webpages that havent been changed by css yet
2. The difference between block level elements and in line elements is block level doesnt go besides each other while inline elements do.
3. Static positioning is the default of all elements 
4. using absolute positioning on an element is useful if you dont want its position to move. Like a header (I used this on my personal site).
5. Fixed position is fixed to that spot on the screen. Absolute is fixed even if you scroll.

## JS
[Functions- Reusable Blocks of Code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)

1. The difference between function delcarations and function invocations is invoking a function means to run the code and declaration is giving the function a name.
2. parameters are the same as arguments

## MISC: Pair Programming

1. Coding with a partner is much more efficient than alone and the most efficient way is normally the fastest and easiest way.
and Having a second set of eyes is super helpful when trying to troubleshoot.
