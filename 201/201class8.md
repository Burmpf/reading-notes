# CSS Layout

## Flexbox
[Learn CSS-Flexbox](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/)
1. It means it is for taking a bunch of content that is different in size and putting it in the best layout possible.
2. The main axis is the one we set with the flex-direction property. the cross axis is just the one that isnt the main. its always counter to it.
3. It can make things different from the html. This causes problems because it onl affects the visual but not the actual code and can reduce accessibility.

1. In a lot of ways floats and positioning is very limiting. Flexbox was designed to make these things easier.
2. Flexbox makes layouts much easier imo. I use flexbox in my personal projects and will be using it for the projects we have in this class.

flex-flow replaces flex direction and flex wrap and combines them.
