## Video and Audio Content
[Video and Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

1. In the early days video used flash to play online but it was not secure and has been replace.
2. src works exactly the same for video that it does for imgs. you can use the controls element to add controls or use a js api that can do it.
3. Fallback content is what you use to display if the browser doesnt support the video. like the alt attribute for imgs. You can even include a link to the video so the user can still see it.
4. Im not writing a story. These are notes for a progressing developer not a childrens book writer.

## Responsive Images
[Responsive IMG's](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

1. It is important to use responsive imgs because it makes the site look better across different sized devices AND it can save bandwidth on mobile devices that require smaller imgs.
2. You can use srcset and sizes to change the img used inside the img tag as shown here: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108432978/196090837-ba94efbc-e2a4-41d7-a80c-982f8d419e5d.png)
3. The reason JS is worse for this is because the img starts to load before the rest of the content and if you used js to resize it it would cause you to load the img twice and its worse than just using the html option.
